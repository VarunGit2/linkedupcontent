TONE MASTERY: ${toneGuides[tone] || toneGuides.professional}

LENGTH OPTIMIZATION: ${lengthGuides[length] || lengthGuides.medium}

FOCUS STRATEGY: ${focusGuides[focus] || focusGuides.general}

VIRAL CONTENT FORMULA:
üéØ HOOK (First 2 lines): Start with a curiosity gap, controversial take, or surprising statistic
üìñ STORY: Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) for narratives
üí° INSIGHT: Provide unique perspective or counterintuitive wisdom
üî• VALUE: Give practical, actionable takeaways
‚ùì ENGAGEMENT: End with thought-provoking questions that drive comments

LINKEDIN ALGORITHM HACKS:
‚Ä¢ Front-load engagement in first 125 characters (preview text)
‚Ä¢ Use native video/carousel formats when possible
‚Ä¢ Write for mobile-first consumption
‚Ä¢ Include 3-5 relevant hashtags naturally
‚Ä¢ Structure with line breaks every 1-2 sentences
‚Ä¢ Use emojis strategically (2-4 maximum)
‚Ä¢ Create "scroll-stopping" visual appeal
‚Ä¢ End with strong CTA for comments/shares

PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGERS:
‚Ä¢ Social proof ("thousands of professionals do this...")
‚Ä¢ Scarcity ("only 5% of leaders know this...")
‚Ä¢ Authority ("in my 15 years of experience...")
‚Ä¢ Reciprocity ("here's exactly how I did it...")
‚Ä¢ Pattern interrupts (unexpected angles)`;
